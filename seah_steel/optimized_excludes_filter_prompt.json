However it may be accepted with prior approval\n from COMPANY subject to below limitations:\n \u2022 Ratio of thickness to diameter of pipe is above 10%.\n \u2022 Products are used for straight sections only.\n \u00a7 Material grades are carbon steel or low alloy steel.\n \u00a7 A formal technical audit has been performed by the COMPANY less than six\n months ahead of the purchase order.\n \u00a7 Heat material and product traceability is complete along the full\n manufacturing process starting from the initial ingot. The ingot is coming\n from identified and approved sources.\n \u00a7 Heat treatment sequence shall be approved. Material is delivered in\n quenched and tempered conditions unless otherwise specified. Final heat\n treatment shall be performed simultaneously from inside and outside of the\n pipe.\n \u00a7 Extent of microstructure examination shall be agreed. The extent of the\n examination shall verify that the manufacturing process does not alter the\n microstructure of the product (on its entire length). Such examination will be\n settled and agreed on with the Manufacturer for its frequency, location on\n products for each heat number, batch of treatment and production line.\n \u00a7 Weldability tests are required on material of the supply unless otherwise\n agreed.\n \u00a7 Considering that such heavy wall pipes are due for high pressure service,\n the whole external and internal surfaces are machined as to eliminate all\n defects inherent to the process. Manual grinding is prohibited for that\n purpose.\n \u00a7 External and internal surfaces are then fully inspected by DPI or MPI and are\n free from any linear indication.\n \u00a7 The inspection and test plan shall clearly identify the sequence of operations\n from receiving ingot. Each process production operation, heat treatment,\n surface preparation and nondestructive operation shall be individually and\n sequentially identified by that document.\n \u00a7 Local weld repair on pipe is not allowed.\n o Longitudinally Welded Pipes\n Longitudinal welded pipes can be provided for larger pipe diameters. ERW welding\n process is not acceptable. For carbon steel, the SAW process shall be used\n exclusively. COMPANY approval shall be required for the welding process prior to\n placing the order.\n A weld joint factor of 1.00 shall be guaranteed.\n The weld seam shall also be welded on the inside (back-welded) if the welding\n process used does not ensure:\n \u00a7 Full penetration\n \u00a7 Weld reinforcement of uniform thickness\n \u00a7 Free of appreciable distortion\n The weld seams shall be subjected to full length (100%) radiographic inspection by\n X-ray method onto radiographic films (Fluoroscopic inspection is not acceptable). The\n acceptance standard for radiography shall be in accordance with applicable material\n specification.\n o Jointers\n Circular welds jointers to attain the minimum allowable length are not permitted\n unless authorized by COMPANY on a case by case basis.\n \u2022 Machining\n o Bevels\n Any beveling of the ends of the pipes shall be performed by flame-cutting. The\n process used shall assure the production of clean, square, burr-free bevel cuts.\n Wherever flame-cutting is employed, all oxides and traces of previously melted metal\n shall be removed by grinding or machining. For stainless steel pipe, cutting and\n beveling shall be performed by mechanical means only; flame cutting is not\n permitted.\n o Weld Reinforcement\n The inside reinforcement of the weld must be ground-off over a length of 10cm at\n each end of the pipe and must leave a gradual transition.\n \u2022 Repair of Defects\n Repairs of defects shall be performed in accordance with the applicable material\n specifications and code\/standard, however repair of base metal by welding is not\n permitted.\n \u2022 Marking\n Each length of pipe shall be marked legibly by low stress die-stamping or by engraving or\n by stenciling. Stencil marking shall utilize water insoluble ink. The ink shall not contain any\n harmful metal or metal salts such as zinc, lead or copper which cause corrosive attack on\n heating. Stainless steel piping shall be supplied with permanent marking over the entire\n length.",
