 a. Inside layer (gel coat or liner): This inside layer shall have a resin content of at
 least 70%. The gel coat may be reinforced by C glass cloth or woven polyester. It
 shall be at least 0.5 mm thick.
 b. The resin used shall be free of pigment or other additives.
 c. Intermediate Layers (providing mechanical strength): These layers shall be of
 glass-reinforced thermosetting resin (generally, the same resin shall be used as
 for the gel coat. If not, the resins must be compatible and provide a bonding
 equivalent or better than identical resins). The resin used must be pigment-free.
 d. Outside layer: This generally is made of the same resin (gel coat) used as for the
 intermediate layers However, subject to the COMPANY prior approval, the
 Manufacturer may use a resin containing the following additives:
 i. Pigments (for protection against UV)
 ii. Graphite (to decrease the surface electrical resistivity)
 iii. Antimony oxide or alumina (to enhance the self-extinguishing properties).
 Carbon fiber may also be inserted in outside layer to insure electrical conductivity.
 Resins:
 The only acceptable synthetic thermosetting resins are epoxy resins and vinyl ester
 resins. Isophthalic or orthophthalic polyester resins shall not be used. However, in the
 case of fluids having a high content of especially corrosive chemicals, selection shall be
 made taking into account Manufacturer's recommendations and polyester of the

 Any lubricant and contamination on the weld bevel or the surrounding areas shall be
 removed before making the seam welds (tack weld and SAW weld) (as per DNV-
 OS-F101 Sec. 7 B321). Weld bevel shall be free from any water or dampness.
 b) Welding parameters
 The welding conditions used for the longitudinal weld and repair welds shall not
 depart from those of the related procedure qualification test.
 However, the following variations shall be acceptable, always providing that variation
 of welding heat input shall be within ± 10%
 · Amperage: ± 10%
 · Voltage: ± 7% (± 10% for manual repairs)
 · Travel speed: ± 10% for automatic welding (± 15% for manual repairs)
 · Preheating/interpass temperature: -0°C, +50°C (providing that max. interpass
 temperature of 280°C is not exceeded).
 Note: The integration time of the parameter display (and/or recorded) mean value
 shall not exceed one second.
 c) Flux coverage
 Specific attention shall be paid to flux coverage of all arcs, especially to the last one
 in case of multi-wires process. Visible arc shall not be permitted.
 d) Tack weld repairs
 The height of tack weld made by automatic welding, if any, shall be indicated on
 WPS. Any repair of tack weld by manual welding may be allowed provided that the
 weld is ground down to the height of the automatic pass.
 Intermittent tack welding shall not be used.
 2. Weld seam geometric characteristics
 a) Weld concavity at pipe ends
 Supplier shall take cares of run on/off tab length, suitable welding speed, effective
 welding start and stop distance from pipe ends, straightening of tabs before external
 welding where necessary, welding wire sequenced stop/start, etc., in order to avoid
 any weld shrinkage concavity at pipe ends. The welding end concavity shall be fully
 located in the tab.
 Internal and external welds at pipe ends shall be inspected before any grinding.
 Where a concavity is found at pipe end, and even if the further grinding can eliminate
 the concavity, the concerned end shall be cut off.
 b) Out-Of-Line Weld Bead
 The offset between the centerlines of the internal and external weld beads shall not
 exceed 3 mm. The narrowest point of the weld bead cross-section shall not be less
 than one-fourth (1/4) of the nominal wall thickness of the pipe with a minimum of 4
 mm (see Figure 1 and 2 of Appendix 8). Checking for bead misalignment shall be
 performed on specimens prepared for hardness test (see § 75.7.5.5 of this
 specification).
 c) Drift of welding groove after forming (welding angle)
 The welding angle due to the groove drift may cause a lack of interpenetration (see
 figures 3 of Appendix 8). The drift angle is affecting the Automatic Ultrasonic Testing
 (AUT) efficiency as well when the AUT weld seam tracking is also not based on pipe
 rotation.
 When the seam tracking system of welding is not based on pipe rotation the special
 inspection requirement of § 75.7.3.2.c shall apply.

 The longitudinal weld seam of UOE/JCOE pipes shall be examined full length by
 multiprobe automatic ultrasonic method according to requirements stated in Appendix
 4. Longitudinal weld at each pipe end shall be inspected by manual UT on those parts
 of the weld not scanned by all probes of the automatic ultrasonic inspection. For Press
 Bending and Roll Bending pipes where manual UT is carried out, the UT procedure shall
 be similar, especially regarding equipment calibration. In all cases, a detailed procedure
 shall be submitted by the SUPPLIER to COMPANY’s approval.
 a) Ultrasonic inspection equipment and procedure
 The equipment shall examine the weld and adjacent area for both longitudinal and
 transverse defects. The inspection shall be efficient in detecting defects in any
 direction, wherever, they are located within the pipe thickness at pipe internal or
 external surfaces.
 The AUT equipment and procedure shall comply with all requirements of Appendix
 4.
 b) Acceptance limits
 Any imperfection which produces a signal of height exceeding the threshold as
 defined in Appendix 4, shall be considered an unacceptable defect, unless it can be
 demonstrated that the imperfection does not exceed the provision of § 75.7.3 and
 75.7.4.2 of this specification. Any imperfection found by the automatic ultrasonic
 system shall be further investigated by radiography and manual ultrasonic testing
 where applicable as per Appendix 4.
 2. Inspection of pipe ends
 The full circumference of each pipe end after beveling shall be ultrasonically checked
 for laminar imperfections over a band 50 mm width with manual or automatic ultrasonic
 tester. This band is extended to 100 mm when AUT on pipe laying girth welds is
 foreseen, refer to PPS when § 75.5.9.4 b) is applicable. This band width is extended to
 60 mm when the inspection is made before beveling.
 Inspection procedure shall be according to ASTM A578/A578M, or EN 10160.

 4. Calibration
 4.1 Static calibration
  
 · Reference level: on each channel, the reference level shall be the lowest of the
 signals produced from the relevant reflectors. It shall be set at 80% FSH.
 · Detection thresholds: the detection trigger thresholds shall be set at 40% FSH.
 · Coupling:
 A coupling type “go/no go” is not acceptable. A coupling control by transmission
 shall be installed for each pair of symmetrical probes.
 The reference level shall be signal received on calibration pipe, in each coupling
 channel.
 The reference level will be set at the SUPPLIER option, but gains and levels shall
 be recorded.
 Gains shall not be modified for production scanning.
 The thresholds of “lacks of coupling” detection shall be set at 8 dB drop
 maximum, below the reference level.
 When production scanning cannot reasonably be achieved with a drop of 8 dB
 maximum, the following procedure will be considered:
 a) The thresholds of coupling by transmission will be increased up to 16 dB drop
 maximum.
 b) One compression probe shall be installed at either side of weld seam
 scanning, at the same distance from the weld as the farthest flaw detection
 probes. The reference level shall be the signal from back wall on calibration
 pipe. The signal shall be set at 80% FSH. The threshold of coupling drop
 detection shall be set at 2 dB drop.
 Note: Where AUT machines are equipped with an automatic coupling adjustment
 system, the SUPPLIER shall demonstrate the efficiency of the equipment, and, as a
 minimum, the above compression probes shall be installed in the conditions described.
 Reporting: The following parameters shall be reported in computer and a print out shall
 be made available at AUT station:
 · A comprehensive detailed list probes/channels, longitudinal/transverse,
 ID/OD/Mid, flaw detection/coupling
 · In each channel, including coupling channels: gain signal height, trigger
 threshold
 · Date, time, operator name and signature, Inspector name and signature.",O

 4. Calibration
 4.2 Dynamic verification (so called dynamic calibration)
 4.2.2 Performance and frequency
  
 On completion of static calibration, a dynamic calibration will be carried out on the
 calibration pipe at production testing speed. The production speed shall not exceed 12
 m/min.
 The dynamic test will be done a minimum of 3 times and the subsequent print outs will
 be evaluated to ensure that the response from each reflector is correct, i.e. not less than
 3 dB (63% FSH) from the reference level (80% FSH)
 If any additional dB is required to maintain the signals to the correct height, the enhanced
 values will be used for production testing. Gate threshold positions are also set at this
 time, ensuring that geometric echoes from weld reinforcement do not interfere with the
 ultrasonic test.
 Dynamic calibration shall also be done at the start of each shift, wherever there is an
 equipment change over, whenever there is an operator change, after every 40
 production testing or every 4 hours, whichever is the first event met, at end of any
 scanning sequence shorter than 4 hours, whenever any doubt arises on the ultrasonic
 efficiency, by agreement between the Inspector and the SUPPLIER.
 A pipe inspection sequence is validated by the dynamic calibration ending the sequence.",O

 SSC tests shall be performed during qualification of pipe manufacturing procedure for 720
 hours. Production tests shall then be carried out at ¼, ½, ¾ and end of pipe production,
 except that test duration shall be 360 hours only (15 days).
 Spare test specimens shall also be cut out and shall be available for additional tests if needed.
 For bends, SSC tests are required on finished bends.
 a) Specimen Examination
 Following failure or at the end of the test (whichever happens first), samples shall
 be cleaned and inspected by visual examination and MPI. Photographs shall be made
 at x1 and x10 magnifications of the stressed surfaces of each specimen.
 Whenever a crack is found, the specimen shall be cut longitudinally at crack location,
 polished and etched. Photographs of the stressed surface and macro-section shall then
 be taken. It shall be metallurgical examined and the metallurgical features recorded
 with photomicrographs. Specimens which do not exhibit crack on their external surface,
 shall be cut transverse to weld (transverse to rolling direction) at 5 mm and at 10 mm
 from their external transverse faces. The sectioned surfaces shall be ground smooth
 with 600 grit emery paper, minimum, following machining.
 Visual examination of unetched sections shall be made at X1, X10 and X100
 magnifications. If cracks are observed, specimens shall be properly etched.
 Photographs shall be made at a suitable magnification before and after etching.
 b) Test Acceptance Criteria
 No crack (or rupture) shall be accepted in any of the tested pipes within the 30 day
 period of testing. Cracks initiated in base material inclusion will not be considered. Little
 grooves or pits caused by corrosion loss will not be considered, in mutual agreement
 between supplier and inspector.
 For production test, if there is a failure the COMPANY may accept to have four pipes
 of the same heat retested. If a re-test fails, the said heat shall be rejected and all heats
 of the said casting sequence shall be tested on two pipes minimum before release or
 reject of each individual heat of the sequence.
 In all cases, re-test pipes shall be selected in mutual agreement between the Supplier
 and the Inspector.
 The Supplier shall investigate and clarify the cause of any failure in order to
 initiate corrective actions / re-testing, to the satisfaction of COMPANY.
