System message:

Your input fields are:
1. `tokens` (list[str]): tokenized text

Your output fields are:
1. `reasoning` (str)
2. `extracted_people` (list[str]): all tokens referring to specific people extracted from the tokenized text

All interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.

[[ ## tokens ## ]]
{tokens}

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
{reasoning}

[[ ## extracted_people ## ]]
{extracted_people}        # note: the value you produce must adhere to the JSON schema: {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}

[[ ## completed ## ]]

In adhering to this structure, your objective is: 
        Extract contiguous tokens referring to specific people, if any, from a list of string tokens.
        Output a list of tokens. In other words, do not combine multiple tokens into a single value.

Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## extracted_people ## ]]` (must be formatted as a valid Python list[str]), and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.
